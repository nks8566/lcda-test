# Weekly Newsletter

A parallel-research task. Coordinate; let the researchers do the digging.

## 1. Pick the genres

- If Jane named genres, use those. Otherwise ask **chinook-analyst** for the
  top 4 genres by revenue across the catalogue and feature those.

## 2. Research in parallel

- For **each** genre, delegate to a **genre-researcher** subagent with the
  `task` tool — fire them all off together so they run in parallel.
- Tell each researcher its one genre and a private folder
  (`/research/<genre>/`) for raw notes. Ask for a single ~120–180 word
  Markdown segment headed `## <Genre>`.
- Do **not** research genres yourself — your job is to assemble.

## 3. Assemble

- Collect the returned segments into one Markdown document:
  - `# This Week in Music` title
  - a one-sentence intro
  - the genre segments, in order

## 4. Render and save

- Call `markdown_to_html` on the assembled Markdown.
- Use the code interpreter to get today's date: `new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 10)`.
- `write_file` the returned HTML to `/outputs/newsletter-<date>.html`.

## Done

Tell Jane where the newsletter was saved and list the genres covered.
